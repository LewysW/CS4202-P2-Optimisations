# CS4202-P2-Optimisations
Second practical on compiler optimisations for CS4202 Computer Architecture

Compilation

1.  Open a terminal window in the ’CS4202-P2-Optimisations/test-suite/’ directory

2.  Navigate to the task directory to compile (task1/ or task2/)1

3.  Run the command ’make’ to run the Makefile

Execution

At this point if the compilation was successful, then the out directory should contain executables, object files, 
and assembly files generated by compiling the program fragments of the current task. 

The executables produced by task 1 are called optimised and unoptimised. These allow each program fragment to be run 
with and without each specified optimisation respectively. 

The executable produced by task 2 is called manual and allows the user to run each program fragment with the appropriate 
implemented manual optimisation.

To run any of the executables:

1.  Open a terminal window in the ’CS4202-P2-Optimisations/test-suite/’ directory

2.  Navigate to the task directory of the desired executable (task1/ or task2/)

3.  Navigate to the out directory of the current task (out/)

4.  Run the following command:

./<executable name> <optimisation flag>

For example:

./optimised -u 

Runs the loop unrolling fragment with the relevantgcc optimisation

./unoptimised -i

Runs the loop interchange fragment without the associated gcc optimisation

5.  Valid flags include the following:

	•-u - run the loop unrolling fragment
	•-i - run the loop interchange fragment
	•-n - run the null pointer check fragment
	•-f - run the inline function fragment
	•-c - run the cross jumping fragment
